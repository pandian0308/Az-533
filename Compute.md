### Availability sets, fault domains, and update domains[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-availability-sets)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/regions-and-availability#availability-sets)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability)

* An Availability Set is a logical grouping capability that Azure ensures VM resources are isolated. The VMs you place within an Availability Set run across multiple physical servers, compute racks, storage units, and network switches.
* An update domain is a group of VMs and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time
* VMs in the same fault domain share common storage as well as a common power source and network switch.
* You can't add an existing VM to an availability set after it is created.
* A fault domain is a logical group of underlying hardware that share a common power source and network switch, similar to a rack within an on-premises datacenter.
* An update domain is a logical group of underlying hardware that can undergo maintenance or be rebooted at the same time.

### Web app for containers[^](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/app-service/containers/)

* Deploy container-based web apps by just pulling container images from Docker Hub or a private Azure Container Registry
* Web App for Containers will deploy the containerised app with your preferred dependencies to production in seconds
* The platform automatically takes care of OS patching, capacity provisioning and load balancing.
* Streamline CI/CD with Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry and GitHub
* App Service on Linux is only supported with Basic and Standard app service plans and does not have a Free or Shared tier.

### VM Scale Sets[^](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/virtual-machine-scale-sets/)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-overview)

* Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of  **identical**, load balanced VMs.
* Azure virtual machine scale sets provide the management capabilities for applications that run across many VMs, automatic scaling of resources, and load balancing of traffic.
* VM scale sets are designed to support true auto-scale – no pre-provisioning of VMs is required – and as such makes it easier to build large-scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized workloads.
* You can set the maximum, minimum and default number of VMs, and define triggers – action rules based on resource consumption.
* Differences between virtual machines and scale sets[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview#differences-between-virtual-machines-and-scale-sets)

### Compute-intensive tasks using Azure Batch[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/)[^](#azure-batch)

### Migration strategy from Cloud Services[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cloud-services-migration-differences)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/service-fabric/migrate-from-cloud-services)[^](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/learning-paths/cloud-services/)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me)

* There are two types of Azure Cloud Services roles:
  * Web role: Automatically deploys and hosts your app through IIS.
  * Worker role: Does not use IIS, and runs your app standalone.

* The Azure Linux Agent is installed on the Linux VM and is responsible to communicate with the Azure Frabric Controller.
* It is a prerequisite that the Virtual Machines can receive ip addresses from DHCP.
* Azure does not use VHDX, only VHD. We are required to convert VHDX to VHD.

### Azure Backup[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/backup/backup-introduction-to-azure-backup)[^](AzureBackup.md)

Components:[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/backup/backup-introduction-to-azure-backup#which-azure-backup-components-should-i-use)

* Azure Backup (MARS) agent - Back up files and folders on physical or virtual Windows OS, supports on-prem VMs, No Linux support. Stores backup in Recovery Services Vault (RSV).

### Azure Site Recovery[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview)

* Azure Recovery Services contribute to your BCDR strategy:
  * Site Recovery service: Site Recovery replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary site to a secondary location during outages
  * Backup Service: The Azure Backup service keeps your data safe and recoverable by backing it up to Azure.
* Azure VMs replicating between Azure regions.
* On-premises VMs and physical servers replicating to Azure, or to a secondary site.

[VMware to Azure replication architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-architecture)

#### Architectural components

The following table and graphic provide a high-level view of the components used for VMware replication to Azure.

**Component** | **Requirement** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
**Azure** | An Azure subscription, Azure Storage account, and Azure network. | Replicated data from on-premises VMs is stored in the storage account. Azure VMs are created with the replicated data when you run a failover from on-premises to Azure. The Azure VMs connect to the Azure virtual network when they're created.
**Configuration server machine** | A single on-premises machine. We recommend that you run it as a VMware VM that can be deployed from a downloaded OVF template.<br/><br/> The machine runs all on-premises Site Recovery components, which include the configuration server, process server, and master target server. | **Configuration server**: Coordinates communications between on-premises and Azure, and manages data replication.<br/><br/> **Process server**: Installed by default on the configuration server. It receives replication data; optimizes it with caching, compression, and encryption; and sends it to Azure Storage. The process server also installs Azure Site Recovery Mobility Service on VMs you want to replicate, and performs automatic discovery of on-premises machines. As your deployment grows, you can add additional, separate process servers to handle larger volumes of replication traffic.<br/><br/> **Master target server**: Installed by default on the configuration server. It handles replication data during failback from Azure. For large deployments, you can add an additional, separate master target server for failback.
**VMware servers** | VMware VMs are hosted on on-premises vSphere ESXi servers. We recommend a vCenter server to manage the hosts. | During Site Recovery deployment, you add VMware servers to the Recovery Services vault.
**Replicated machines** | Mobility Service is installed on each VMware VM that you replicate. | We recommend that you allow automatic installation from the process server. Alternatively, you can install the service manually or use an automated deployment method, such as System Center Configuration Manager.

#### Recommended high availability "best practices" for virtual machines deployment:

* Configure multiple virtual machines in an availability set - for redundancy
* Use managed disks for VMs in an availability set
* Use Scheduled Events to proactively response to VM impacting events
* Configure each application tier into separate availability sets
* Combine a Load Balancer with availability sets
* Use availability zones to protect from datacenter level failures

## Serverless Computing[^](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/serverless-computing/)

* Serverless computing is the abstraction of servers, infrastructure and operating systems.
* Serverless computing is driven by the reaction to events and triggers happening in near-real-time—in the cloud

### Web Jobs[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/app-service/web-sites-create-web-jobs)

### Use Azure Functions to implement event-driven actions[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview)

* Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure
* Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud
* Key features of Functions are:
  * Choice of language
  * Pay-per-use pricing model
  * Bring your own dependencies
  * Integrated Security
  * Simplified integration
  * Flexible development
  * Open-source
* Functions is a great solution for processing data, integrating systems, working with the internet-of-things (IoT), and building simple APIs and micro-services
* Functions provides templates to get you started with key scenarios, including the following:
  * HTTPTrigger
  * TimerTrigger
  * GitHub Webhook
  * Generic Webhook
  * CosmosDBTrigger
  * BlobTrigger
  * QueueTrigger
  * EventHubTrigger
  * ServiceBusQueueTrigger
  * ServiceBusTopicTrigger
* A trigger defines how a function is invoked. A function must have exactly one trigger. Triggers have associated data, which is usually the payload that triggered the function.
* Input and output bindings provide a declarative way to connect to data from within your code. Bindings are optional and a function can have multiple input and output bindings.

### Azure Container Instances

* Azure Container Instances is a great solution for any scenario that can operate in isolated containers, including simple applications, task automation, and build jobs.
* For scenarios where you need full container orchestration, including service discovery across multiple containers, automatic scaling, and coordinated application upgrades, use Azure Container Service (AKS).
* Benefits of Containers:
  * Fast startup times
  * Public IP connectivity and DNS name
  * Hypervisor-level security
  * Custom Sizes
  * Linux and Windows Containers
  * Co-scheduled groups
* Because of their small size and application orientation, containers are well suited for agile delivery environments and microservice-based architectures. 

### Design application solutions by using Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, or both[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-serverless-overview)

* Serverless applications offer benefits of an increase in speed of development, reduction in required code, and simplicity with scale.
* The core services in Azure around Serverless are Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps. 
* Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud.
* Azure Logic Apps provides a way to simplify and implement scalable integrations and workflows in the cloud.

### Container-orchestration[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes)

* The task of automating and managing a large number of containers and how they interact is known as orchestration. Popular container orchestrators include Kubernetes, DC/OS, and Docker Swarm.
* Azure Container Service (AKS) makes it simple to create, configure, and manage a cluster of virtual machines that are preconfigured to run containerized applications.
* As a managed Kubernetes service, AKS provides:
  * Automated Kubernetes version upgrades and patching
  * Easy cluster scaling
  * Self-healing hosted control plane (masters)
    * Cost savings - pay only for running agent pool nodes
* Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. With AKS, provisioning of a production ready Kubernetes cluster is simple and quick.

### Azure Service Fabric (ASF)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-overview)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-content-roadmap)

* Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices and containers.
* Service Fabric provides three broad areas to help you build applications that use a microservices approach:
  * A platform that provides system services to deploy, upgrade, detect, and restart failed services, discover services, route messages, manage state, and monitor health. 
  * Ability to deploy applications either running in containers or as processes. Service Fabric is a container and process orchestrator.
  * Productive programming APIs, to help you build applications as microservices: ASP.NET Core, Reliable Actors, and Reliable Services.
* A Service Fabric cluster is a network-connected set of virtual or physical machines into which your microservices are deployed and managed. Clusters can scale to thousands of machines.
* A stateful service uses Service Fabric to manage your service's state via its Reliable Collections or Reliable Actors programming models.
* A key differentiation with Service Fabric is its strong focus on building stateful services, either with the built in programming models or with containerized stateful services
* Service Fabric supported programming models:[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-choose-framework)
  * Containers
  * Reliable Services
  * Reliable Actors - framework uses independent units of compute and state with single-threaded execution called actors
  * ASP.NET Core
  * Guest executables

* Service Fabric Application Scenarios[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-scenarios) - The Service Fabric platform in Azure is ideal for the following categories of applications:
    * Highly available services - provide fast failover
    * Scalable services - services can be partitioned, allowing for state to be scaled out across the cluster
    * Computation on nonstatic data - allows the collocation of processing (computation) and data in applications
    * Session-based interactive applications - such as online gaming or instant messaging that require low latency reads and writes
    * Data analytics and workflows - transactional and financial systems - handles large scale and has low latency through its stateful services

* Isolated and dedicated environments [App Service environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/intro)

### Custom Web API[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app)

* Custom APIs and custom connectors are web APIs that use REST for pluggable interfaces, Swagger metadata format for documentation, and JSON as their data exchange format. 
* A custom API works best with logic apps when the API also has a Swagger document that describes the API's operations and parameters.
* Custom API should provide actions. A basic action is a controller that accepts HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses.
* Action Patterns
  * Perform long-running tasks with the **polling action pattern**
  * Perform long-running tasks with the **webhook action pattern**
* Trigger patterns
  * Check for new data or events regularly with the **polling trigger pattern**
  * Wait and listen for new data or events with the **webhook trigger pattern**

#### [On-Premises PowerBI Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/power-bi/service-gateway-getting-started)

A gateway is software that facilitates access to data that resides on a private, on-premises network, for subsequent use in a cloud service like Power BI.

* Hybrid Connections is both a service in Azure and a feature in Azure App Service.

### Secure Web API [^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-custom-api-authentication)

* Authentication and Authorization in Web API
    * *Authentication* is knowing the identity of the user
    * *Authorization* is deciding whether a user is allowed to perform an action
    * Web API assumes that authentication happens in the host(IIS), IIS uses HTTP modules for authentication.
    * Alernatively, authentication logic can be put into an HTTP message handler
    * Authorization happens later in the pipeline, closer to the controller.
    * Authorization filters run before the controller action
    * Web API provides a built-in authorization filter, **AuthorizeAttribute**.
  
* Secure a Web API with Individual Accounts in Web API 2.2
    * Secure a web API using OAuth2 to authenticate against a membership database
    * Web API project template gives you three options for authentication:
        * Individual accounts. The app uses a membership database.
        * Organizational accounts. Users sign in with their Azure Active Directory, Office 365, or on-premise Active Directory credentials.
        * Windows authentication. This option is intended for Intranet applications, and uses the Windows Authentication IIS module.
    * Individual accounts provide two ways for a user to log in:
        * Local Login - The user registers at the site
        * Social Login - The user signs in with external social media account
    * For both local and social login, Web API uses OAuth2 to authenticate requests
* External Authentication Services with Web API (C#)
    * to integrate with external authentication services, which include several OAuth/OpenID and social media authentication services: Microsoft Accounts, Twitter, Facebook, and Google.

* Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks in Web API
    * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where a malicious site sends a request to a vulnerable site where the user is currently logged in
    * Using SSL does not prevent a CSRF attack, because the malicious site can send an "https://" request.
    * CSRF attacks are possible against web sites that use cookies for authentication, because browsers send all relevant cookies to the destination web site. Basic and Digest authentication are also vulnerable
    * To help prevent CSRF attacks, ASP.NET MVC uses anti-forgery tokens, also called request verification tokens.
    * Same-origin policies prevent documents hosted on two different sites from accessing each other's content
* Enabling Cross-Origin Requests in Web API 2
    * Browser security prevents a web page from making AJAX requests to another domain. This restriction is called the same-origin policy, and prevents a malicious site from reading sensitive data from another site. 
    * Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a W3C standard that allows a server to relax the same-origin policy. 
    * Using CORS, a server can explicitly allow some cross-origin requests while rejecting others.
* Authentication Filters in Web API 2
    * An authentication filter is a component that authenticates an HTTP request
    * Authentication filters let you set an authentication scheme for individual controllers or actions.
    * authentication filters can be applied per-controller, per-action, or globally to all Web API controllers.
    * "Host-level authentication" is authentication performed by the host (such as IIS), before the request reaches the Web API framework.
    * [Web API Security Filter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/dn781361.aspx) (MSDN Magazine)
* Basic Authentication in Web API
    * Basic authentication is performed within the context of a "realm."
    * The credentials are sent unencrypted, Basic authentication is only secure over HTTPS.
    * Basic authentication is also vulnerable to CSRF attacks
* Forms Authentication in Web API
    * Forms authentication uses an HTML form to send the user's credentials to the server.
    * Forms authentication is only appropriate for web APIs that are called from a web application, so that the user can interact with the HTML form.
    * Advantages:
        * Easy to implement: Built into ASP.NET.
        * Uses ASP.NET membership provider, which makes it easy to manage user accounts
    * Disadvantages:
        * Not a standard HTTP authentication mechanism;
        * uses HTTP cookies instead of the standard Authorization header.
        * Requires a browser client.
        * Credentials are sent as plaintext.
        * Vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
        * Requires anti-CSRF measures.
        * Difficult to use from nonbrowser clients.
        * Login requires a browser.
        * User credentials are sent in the request. Some users disable cookies.
* Integrated Windows Authentication
    * Integrated Windows authentication enables users to log in with their Windows credentials, using Kerberos or NTLM.
    * The client sends credentials in the Authorization header.
    * Windows authentication is best suited for an intranet environment
    * Windows authentication is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
    * Advantages:
        * Built into IIS.
        * Does not send the user credentials in the request.
        * If the client computer belongs to the domain (for example, intranet application), the user does not need to enter credentials
    * Disadvantages:
        * Not recommended for Internet applications.
        * Requires Kerberos or NTLM support in the client.
        * Client must be in the Active Directory domain.
* Working with SSL
    * Basic authentication and forms authentication send unencrypted credentials. To be secure, these authentication schemes must use SSL. 
    * In addition, SSL client certificates can be used to authenticate clients.
    * SSL provides authentication by using Public Key Infrastructure certificates
    * Advantages:
        * Certificate credentials are stronger than username/password.
        * SSL provides a complete secure channel, with authentication, message integrity, and message encryption.
    * Disadvantages:
        * must obtain and manage PKI certificates.
        * The client platform must support SSL client certificates.

### Web Apps for scalability and performance[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/app-service-web-app/scalable-web-app)

#### Azure App Service Local Cache[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/app-service/app-service-local-cache-overview#best-practices-for-using-app-service-local-cache)

* Provides a web role view of your content. Web apps that run on Local Cache have the following benefits:
    * They are immune to latencies that occur when they access content on Azure Storage.
    * They are immune to the planned upgrades or unplanned downtimes and any other disruptions with Azure Storage that occur on servers that serve the content share.
    * They have fewer app restarts due to storage share changes.
* The local cache is a copy of the /site and /siteextensions folders of the web app.
* Use Local Cache if your web app needs a high-performance, reliable content store, that does not use the content store to write critical data at runtime, and is less than 2 GB in total size 

#### SignalR[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-signalr)

* ASP.NET SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications.
* Real-time web functionality is the ability to have server code push content to connected clients instantly as it becomes available, rather than having the server wait for a client to request new data.
* SignalR can be used to add any sort of "real-time" web functionality to your ASP.NET application.
* Examples include Chats, dashboards and monitoring applications, collaborative applications (such as simultaneous editing of documents), job progress updates, and real-time forms.
* The SignalR API contains two models for communicating between clients and servers: Persistent Connections and Hubs.

### Multi region, high availability Azure web apps[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/app-service-web-app/multi-region)

Azure App Service application in multiple regions to achieve high availability![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/app-service-web-app/images/multi-region-web-app-diagram.png)

* A multi-region architecture can provide higher availability than deploying to a single region. 
* If a regional outage affects the primary region, you can use Traffic Manager to fail over to the secondary region.
*  General approaches to achieving high availability across regions:
    * Active/passive with hot standby - Hot standby means the VMs in the secondary region are allocated and running at all times.
    * Active/passive with cold standby - Cold standby means the VMs in the secondary region are not allocated until needed for failover. This approach costs less to run, but will generally take longer to come online during a failure.
    * Active/active -  Both regions are active, and requests are load balanced between them

### App Service plans[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview)

* An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run. These compute resources are analogous to the server farm in conventional web hosting. 
* categories of pricing tiers:
  * **Shared compute** : Free and Shared -  runs an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers. The resources cannot scale out. Use only for development and testing purposes.
  * **Dedicated compute**: The Basic, Standard, Premium, and PremiumV2 tiers -run apps on dedicated Azure VMs. Only apps in the same App Service plan share the same compute resources.
  * **Isolated** : runs dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure VNets, which provides network isolation on top of compute isolation. It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.
  * **Consumption**: only available to function apps. It scales the functions dynamically depending on workload.
* The new PremiumV2 pricing tier provides Dv2-series VMs with faster processors, SSD storage, and double memory-to-core ratio compared to Standard tier. 

### Business Continuity[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/resiliency/disaster-recovery-azure-applications)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/architecture/resiliency/index)

* Business continuity (BC), is the ability to perform essential business functions during and after adverse conditions, such as a natural disaster or a downed service. BC covers the entire operation of the business, including physical facilities, people, communications, transportation, and IT.
* Disaster recovery (DR) is focused on recovering from a catastrophic loss of application functionality.
* Paired regions[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions) - Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography, together making a regional pair
* Paired region benifits - Physical Isolation, Platform provided replication, region recovery order, sequential updates, Data residency.
* Azure Site Recovery provides a simple way to replicate Azure VMs between regions
* Azure Traffic Manager[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) - uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to direct client requests to the most appropriate endpoint based on a traffic-routing method and the health of the endpoints.
* Azure disaster scenarios - Application failure, Data corruption, Network outage, Failure of a dependent service, Region-wide service disruption, Azure-wide service disruption, Reduced application functionality

### Azure App Service Environment (ASE)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/intro)

* The Azure App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale.
* App Service environments (ASEs) are appropriate for application workloads that require:
    * Very high scale.
    * Isolation and secure network access.
    * High memory utilization.

### API apps[^](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/app-service/api/)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-rest-api)

### API management service[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts)

* API Management (APIM) helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services.
* The **API gateway** is the endpoint that accepts API calls and routes them to your backends.
* The **Azure portal** is the administrative interface where you set up your API program
* The **Developer portal** serves as the main web presence for developers

### Web Apps on Linux[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/app-service/containers/app-service-linux-intro)

* Customers can use App Service on Linux to host web apps natively on Linux for supported application stacks.
* App Service on Linux supports a number of Built-in images
* App Service on Linux is only supported with Basic and Standard app service plans and does not have a Free or Shared tier
* You cannot create Web App for Containers in an App Service plan already hosting non-Linux Web Apps.
* App Service on Linux offers two different paths to getting your application published to the web:
    * Custom image deployment: "Dockerize" your app into a Docker image that contains all of your files and dependencies in a ready-to-run package.
    * App deployment with a built-in platform image: Our built-in platform images contain common web app runtimes and dependencies, such as Node and PHP. 

### CDN[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-overview)

* A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users.
* CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency. 
* Benefits of using Azure CDN to deliver web site assets include:
    * Better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are required to load content.
    * Large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event.
    * Distribution of user requests and serving of content directly from edge servers so that less traffic is sent to the origin server.
* The file remains cached on the edge server in the POP until the time-to-live (TTL) specified by its HTTP headers expires
* The default TTL is seven days.
* Azure CDN offers the following key features:
    * Dynamic site acceleration
    * CDN caching rules
    * HTTPS custom domain support
    * Azure diagnostics logs
    * File compression
    * Geo-filtering

### Using Cache [^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-how-caching-works), Azure Redis Cache[^](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cache/)

[Azure App Service, Virtual Machines, Service Fabric, and Cloud Services comparison](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/choose-web-site-cloud-service-vm?toc=%2fazure%2fapp-service%2fcontainers%2ftoc.json)

## High Performance Computing, Compute-intensive Applications[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/high-performance-computing)

Azure provides flexible solutions to distribute work and scale to thousands of VMs or cores and then scale down when you need fewer resources. 

### Design High-performance computing (HPC) and other Compute-intensive applications using Azure Services

### Azure Batch

* Azure Batch creates and manages a pool of compute nodes (virtual machines), installs the applications you want to run, and schedules jobs to run on the nodes.
* There is no cluster or job scheduler software to install, manage, or scale. Instead, you use Batch APIs and tools, command-line scripts, or the Azure portal to configure, manage, and monitor your jobs.
* Intrinsically parallel workloads are those where the applications can run independently, and each instance completes part of the work
* Examples of intrinsically parallel workloads you can bring to Batch:
    * Financial risk modeling using Monte Carlo simulations
    * VFX and 3D image rendering
    * Image analysis and processing
    * Media transcoding
    * Genetic sequence analysis
    * Optical character recognition (OCR)
    * Data ingestion, processing, and ETL operations
    * Software test execution
* Tightly coupled workloads need to communicate with each other, as opposed to run independently. Tightly coupled applications normally use the Message Passing Interface (MPI) API.
* Examples of tightly coupled workloads:
    * Finite element analysis
    * Fluid dynamics
    * Multi-node AI training
* Batch supports large-scale rendering workloads with rendering tools including Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, Arnold, and V-Ray. 
* R users can install the doAzureParallel R package to easily scale out the execution of R algorithms on Batch pools.
* Run Batch jobs as part of a larger Azure workflow to transform data, managed by tools such as Azure Data Factory.
* Use Low priority VMs with Batch[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-low-pri-vms) for Development and Testing, Suplimenting on-demand capacity, and for jobs with flexible execution time.
* Long-running MPI jobs that utilize multiple VMs are not well suited to use low-priority VMs

Batch Service Resources:[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#batch-service-resources)

* Account
* Compute node - VM that is dedicated to processing a portion of your application's workload
* Pool - collection of nodes that your application runs on
* Job - A job is a collection of tasks
    * Job schedules - create recurring jobs
* Task - unit of computation that is associated with a job and runs on a node
    * Start task
    * Job manager task - control and/or monitor job execution
    * Job preparation and release tasks
    * Multi-instance task (MPI)
    * Task dependencies
* Application packages - provide simplified deployment and versioning of the applications that your tasks run

### Design stateless components to accommodate scale [^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/checklist/scalability)

* Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increased load.
* Application design:
    * Partition the workload
    * Design for scaling - the application and the services it uses must be stateless, to allow requests to be routed to any instance. 
    * Scale as a unit
    * Avoid client affinity
    * Autoscaling capability
    * Offload intensive CPU/IO tasks as background tasks
    * Distribute the workload for background tasks
    * shared-nothing architecture
* Data management
    * Use data partitioning
    * Design for eventual consistency
    * Reduce chatty interactions between components and services
    * Use queues to level the load for high velocity data writes
    * Minimize the load on the data store
    * Minimize the volume of data retrieved
    * Aggressively use caching
    * Handle data growth and retention
    * Optimize Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) using an efficient binary format
    * Set cache control
    * Enable client side caching.
    * Use Azure blob storage and the Azure Content Delivery Network to reduce the load on the application
    * Optimize and tune SQL queries and indexes
    * Consider de-normalizing data.
