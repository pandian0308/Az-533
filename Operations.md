Log Analytics plays a central role in Azure management by collecting telemetry and other data from a variety of sources and providing a query language and analytics engine that gives you insights into the operation of your applications and resources.

* Log Analytics includes a rich query language to quickly retrieve, consolidate, and analyze collected data
* Views in Log Analytics visually present data from log searches.

### Application Insights[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-overview)

  * [Workbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-usage-workbooks) - sections of independently editable usage visualizations, charts, tables, text, or Analytics query results.

## Monitoring Azure Platform and Alerting

Azure Monitor enables core monitoring for Azure services by allowing the collection of metrics, activity logs, and diagnostic logs. 

### Azure Service Health[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/)

* Azure Service Health can notify you, help you understand the impact of issues, and keep you updated as the issue resolves.
* Prepare for planned maintenance and changes that could affect the availability of your resources.
* Components of Azure Health:
  * Azure Status - a global view of health of Azure services, real time status updates and history pages
  * Service Health - a personalized view of health of Azure services, provides a customizable dashboard. Tracks 3 types of health events:
    * Service issues (any ongoing problems)
    * Planned maintenance
    * Health advisories
  * Resource Health - a deeper view of the health of the individual resources provisioned to you by your Azure services, provides technical support to help you mitigate problems. Resource Health statuses are:
    * Available
    * Unavailable
    * Non-platform events - triggered by users' actions
    * Unknown - no update since 10 mins
    * Degraded - detected a loss in performance

### Azure Advisor[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview)

* Advisor is a personalized cloud consultant that helps to follow best practices to optimize Azure deployments.
* constantly monitors your resource configuration and usage telemetry.
* Get proactive, actionable, and personalized best practices recommendations
* Improve the performance, security, and high availability of your resources, as you identify opportunities to reduce your overall Azure spend
* Get recommendations with proposed actions inline. 
* Categories of recomendation:
  * High Availability
  * Security
  * Performance
  * Cost
* Advisor provides recommendations for virtual machines, availability sets, application gateways, App Services, SQL servers, and Redis Cache.

### Activity Log[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-activity-logs)

* Categories of data in Activity Log: 
    * Administrative - Resource Manager operations
    * Service Health - events: Action Required, Assisted Recovery, Incident, Maintenance, Information, or Security
    * Alert - record of activation of Azure alerts
    * Autoscale - events related to the operation of the autoscale engine
    * Recommendation - events offer recommendations for how to better utilize your resources
    * Security - alerts generated by Azure Security Center
    * Policy and Resource Health - reserved for future use

### Diagnostics Logs[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-of-diagnostic-logs)

* Resource-level diagnostic logs provide insight into operations that were performed within that resource itself.
* Resource-level diagnostic logs differ from the Activity Log and guest OS-level diagnostic logs
* Activity Log provides insight into the operations that were performed on resources.
* Guest OS diagnostic logs are those collected by an agent running inside of a virtual machine or other supported resource type.
* Resource-level diagnostic logs require no agent and capture resource-specific data from the Azure platform itself, while guest OS-level diagnostic logs capture data from the operating system and applications running on a virtual machine.

    * If you already own OMS
    * If you already have PowerShell expertise

[Starting an Azure Automation runbook with a webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-webhooks)

* A webhook allows you to start a particular runbook in Azure Automation through a single HTTP request.
* This allows external services such as Visual Studio Team Services, GitHub, Azure Log Analytics, or custom applications to start runbooks without implementing a full solution using the Azure Automation API.

### Chef[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/virtual-machines/windows/chef-automation?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-machines%2Fwindows%2Ftoc.json)

* Chef has three main architectural components: Chef Server, Chef Client (node), and Chef Workstation.

### PowerShell[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/powershell/azure/overview?view=azurermps-5.7.0)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/powershell/dsc/overview)

* Azure PowerShell provides a set of cmdlets that use the Azure Resource Manager model for managing your Azure resources.
* Use the Cloud Shell to run the Azure PowerShell in your browser or install it on own computer
* PowerShell supports asynchronous action with PowerShell Jobs.
* PowerShell background jobs run a command or expression in the background without interacting with the current session.
* Azure PowerShell also provides an -AsJob switch on some long-running cmdlets
* DSC is a management platform in PowerShell that enables you to manage your IT and development infrastructure with configuration as code
* DSC is a declarative platform used for configuration, deployment, and management of systems.
* Three primary components:
    * Configurations - are declarative PowerShell scripts which define and configure instances of resources
    * Resources - A resource exposes properties that can be configured (schema) and contains the PowerShell script functions that LCM calls
    * Local Configuration Manager (LCM) - is the engine by which DSC facilitates the interaction between resources and configurations.

### Desired State Configuration (DSC)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-dsc-overview)

* Azure Automation DSC is an Azure service that allows you to write, manage, and compile PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) configurations, import DSC Resources, and assign configurations to target nodes, all in the cloud.
* Azure Automation DSC provides several advantages over using DSC outside of Azure:
    * Built-in pull server - target nodes automatically receive configurations, conform to the desired state, and report back on their compliance.
    * Management of all your DSC artifacts
    * Import reporting data into Log Analytics
* Install or remove windows roles and features
* Running Windows PowerShell scripts
* Managing registry settings
* Managing files and directories

* Every logic app workflow starts with a trigger, which fires when a specific event happens, or when new available data meets specific criteria.

### Azure Autoscale[^](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/autoscale/)[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-autoscale)

* Autoscale is a built-in feature of Cloud Services, Mobile Services, Virtual Machines, and Websites that helps applications perform their best when demand changes
* Autoscale allows you to have the right amount of resources running to handle the load on your application.
*  It allows you to add resources to handle increases in load and also save money by removing resources that are sitting idle.

### Azure Scheduler[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/scheduler/scheduler-intro)

* Azure Scheduler allows you to declaratively describe actions to run in the cloud. It then schedules and runs those actions automatically.
* It invokes via HTTP, HTTPS, a storage queue, a service bus queue, or a service bus topic.
* Recurring application actions - Periodically gathering data from Twitter into a feed
* Daily maintenance - Daily pruning of logs, performing backups, and other maintenance tasks
