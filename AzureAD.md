## Azure Active Directory [^](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/)

* Azure AD is a directory service in Azure
* Azure AD Service is not a replacement for Windows Server Active Directory
* **Azure AD Connect** synchronization services used to synch on-prem AD groups and users to Azure AD, which is called **Hybrid Identity**
* AD Connect is successor to DirSync, AzureADSync, Forefront Identity Manager.
* Azure AD can be associated with an on-premises Active Directory to support single sign-on (SSO).
* True SSO using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) or shared sign-on, in which Azure AD Connect is used to sync a password hash between Active Directory and Azure AD
* Azure AD is accessible via a modern REST API, Graph REST APIs.

Azure AD serves as key component for identity management in MS cloud and has the following capabilities:
* Multi-Factor Authentication,
* Device registration,
* Role Based Access Control (RBAC),
* Application usage monitoring,
* Security Monitoring and Alerting,
* Self-serivce password management
