* Azure Stream Analytics is a managed event-processing engine set up real-time analytic computations on streaming data
* The data can come from devices, sensors, web sites, social media feeds, applications, infrastructure systems, and more
* Use Stream Analytics to examine high volumes of data streaming from devices or processes, extract information from that data stream, identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
* The data can be ingested into Azure from a device using an Azure event hub or IoT hub. The data can also be pulled from a data store like Azure Blob Storage.
* Stream Analytics can handle up to 1 GB of incoming data per second
* Response to analysis:
    * Send a command to change device settings. 
    * Send data to a monitored queue for further action based on findings (such as event hubs, Azure Service Bus, queues)
    * Send data to a Power BI dashboard.
    * Send data to storage like Data Lake Store, Azure SQL Database, or Azure Blob storage.
* Stream Analytics provides a SQL-like language for creating transformations (SQL DSL)
* Azure provides multiple solutions for analyzing streaming data: Azure Streaming Analytics and Apache Storm on Azure HDInsight
* Stream Analytics pricing is based on volume of data processed and the number of streaming units required per hour that the job is running
* Apache Storm on HDInsight pricing is cluster-based, and is charged based on the time the cluster is running, independent of jobs deployed
* Stream Analytics enables developers to use Tumbling, Hopping and Sliding windows to perform temporal operations on streaming data

|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Device-to-cloud messaging | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Protocols: HTTPS, AMQP, AMQP over websockets | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Protocols: MQTT, MQTT over websockets | Yes | Yes | |
| Per-device identity | Yes | Yes | |
| File upload from devices | Yes | Yes | |
| Device Provisioning Service | Yes | Yes | |

Gateways:
* A protocol gateway performs protocol translation, for example MQTT to AMQP
* A field gateway can:
    * Run analytics on the edge.
    * Make time-sensitive decisions to reduce latency.
    * Provide device management services.
    * Enforce security and privacy constraints.
    * Perform protocol translation.

### Event Hub[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs)

* Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable data streaming platform and event ingestion service, capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second.
* Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters
* Event Hub is different from Azure Service Bus messaging, and does not implement some of the capabilities that are available for Service Bus messaging entities, such as topics.

Event Hubs features:
* Event producers/publishers: An event is published via AMQP 1.0 or HTTPS
* Capture
* Partitions: Enables each consumer to only read a specific subset, or partition, of the event stream
* Event consumers

### Notification Hub[^](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-push-notification-overview)

* Azure Notification Hubs provide an easy-to-use, multi-platform, scaled-out push engine.
* a single cross-platform API call to send targeted and personalized push notifications to any mobile platform from any cloud or on-premises backend
* Push notifications is a form of app-to-user communication where users of mobile apps are notified of certain desired information, usually in a pop-up or dialog box
* Push notifications are delivered through platform-specific infrastructures called Platform Notification Systems (PNSes)
* Notification Hubs is offered in three tiers—free, basic and standard. Base charge and quotas are applied at the namespace level[^](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/notification-hubs/)

Challenges of Push Notifications:

* Platform dependency
* Scale - device tokens must be refreshed upon every app launch, broadcast support
* Routing - backend must maintain a registry to associate devices with interest groups, users, properties, etc.

Cross Platform Push notifications using Azure[^](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn879353.aspx)

Notification Hub advantages:
* Cross platforms - iOS, Android, Windows, and Kindle and Baidu

* Rich set of delivery patterns:
    * Broadcast to one or multiple platforms
    * Push to device
    * Push to user
    * Push to segment with dynamic tags
    * Localized push
    * Silent push
